### Posting Schedule

#### Community Bonding Period (17th May - 7th June)
I will be posting once a week, since my pre work is mainly reading documentation and tutorials. Expect posts on 24th May, 31st May and 7th June.
#### Coding Period (7th June - 23rd August)
I will be updating what I did daily, with a summary post about what I did, what issues I'm facing and how I'm going to solve them at the end of the week. Also, I will write two posts on [the BeagleBoard blog](https://beagleboard.org/blog/) during the two evaluation periods - mid July and mid August.
