# Hi,
## I'm Archisman Dey,
an undergraduate student studying Electronics and Electrical Engineering at IIT Guwahati. I have been coding since
I was 15 and have programming experience with C, C++ and Python and some experience with embedded systems.
You can check out [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/archisman-dey) to look at some of my projects.

I have been selected for Google Summer of Code 2021 under BeagleBoard.org and I will be
working on Improvements to simpPRU. You can read about my proposal on [eLinux](https://elinux.org/BeagleBoard/GSoC/2021_Proposal/simpPRU_Improvements).
