**Hello from Archisman,**

This is my personal site, used as a collection of links to interesting or useful or weird or funny things I come across. Its also what I am using to learn html/css.

*Update*

You can only have one user github page per account and I wanted to do something else with mine without deleting this old one, so it now lives in /classic
